Housing Affordability Analysis — San Francisco vs San Diego

## Overview:
This project analyzes **housing affordability disparities** between **San Francisco** and **San Diego**, California.  
Using publicly available datasets on **real estate prices** and **median household incomes**, the analysis estimates affordability gaps across ZIP codes to identify where housing is most and least accessible for the average resident.  

The study uses Python for data cleaning, visualization, and affordability modeling — applying a **Debt-to-Income (DTI)**–based affordability formula that mirrors U.S. housing authority and lender standards.  

## Objectives:
- Quantify the **affordability gap** (difference between actual and affordable home prices) for each ZIP code.  
- Compare **regional trends** in income, price per square foot, and affordability stress.  
- Identify **key factors** driving housing inaccessibility — income disparity vs price escalation.  
- Provide **data-driven insights** to policymakers, planners, and developers.  

 **Visualizations**
   - Bar and box plots to show income–price disparities.  
   - Regression plots highlighting correlation between price and income.  
   - Comparative charts between San Diego and San Francisco ZIPs.  

## Key Insights:
- **San Francisco** shows severe affordability stress — even higher median incomes can’t offset extreme price escalation.  
- **San Diego** demonstrates relatively **better affordability balance**, though coastal ZIPs remain under pressure.  
- The **affordability gap** is primarily price-driven rather than income-driven.  
- Interest rate fluctuations can **significantly alter affordability** — small increases reduce accessible home prices dramatically.
